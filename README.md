I'm going to complete this challenge for educational purposes (Programmin/Problem solving/Working with git and github/Improving/Debugging/Software design and...). By the writing of this i'm just a beginner programmer. I'll update the completed challenges so I can improve them.

And who knows? maybe some of the programs turned out to be good! that's why i rate myself for any completed project (based on levels of functionality and efficiency).
